- **Ask for restore points** before making changes
- **Modular design** - apply only what you want
- **Extensive testing** on various hardware configurations
- **Open source** - you can check every line of code
- **Manual testing** - All tweaks have been manually tested across multiple hardware configurations
- **Logging** - Detailed logging file can be found in `%APPDATA%/optimizerDuck/` directory

## Mindset Matters

* A powerful PC means little if it's not used efficiently.
* Real performance isn't just about tweaks or tools — it's about **how you manage your system**.

**Best practices:**
- Keep your OS lean: avoid unnecessary VPNs, multiple antiviruses, or background apps.
- When gaming, close what you don't need (browsers, IDEs, chat apps, etc.).
- Fewer distractions = more resources for what really matters.
