## Mindset Matters

* A powerful PC means little if it's not used efficiently.
* Real performance isn't just about tweaks or tools. It's about **how you manage your system**.

**Best practices:**
- Keep your OS lean: avoid unnecessary VPNs, multiple antiviruses, or background apps.
- When gaming, close what you don't need (browsers, IDEs, chat apps, etc.).
- Fewer distractions = more resources for what really matters.

## Why I Built optimizerDuck

I run games on a **low-spec PC**, so smooth play is always a struggle. I spent hours digging through forums and community threads, trying everything I could find: **editing configs**, **applying `.reg` tweaks**, **running shell commands**, and **using third-party tools**. Those tweaks helped, but I never found a "**tweaker**" that felt right. Some **cost money**, some **looked fake**, and many **didn't** let me choose the exact changes I wanted.

I made this tool because I enjoy tweaking my system and wanted something simple and honest I could control. **Every tweak** here has been **tested** by me and carefully chosen to improve gameplay without surprises.
