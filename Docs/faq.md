## Is optimizerDuck a virus?

Absolutely not. **optimizerDuck** is **open-source** and you can inspect every line of code yourself.  
It does not contain malware, spyware, or hidden installers.  
All tweaks are transparent and documented in this repository.

For peace of mind:
- Review the source code in [GitHub](../).
- Build the project yourself from source.
- Check the [Safety Guidelines](safety.md).

## Why does optimizerDuck restart the app every time I open it?

**optimizerDuck** requires a restart on each launch because:
- Administrator permissions are always needed to apply system-level tweaks.
- The app opens in a maximized window so all options are clearly visible.
